Here's a cool music tracks application project.  

It's a web application designed for music enthusiasts to manage their beats (tracks) effortlessly. Here are some key features:

1. **CRUD Operations**: Users can upload new tracks, edit existing ones, and delete tracks they no longer need.
1. **Public and Private Tracks**: Users can define their tracks as public or private, giving them control over who can access their music.
1. **Seamless Design**: The application boasts a sleek and easy-to-use interface, ensuring a smooth user experience.

I believe the design and usability of the application make it a standout tool for music creators.
